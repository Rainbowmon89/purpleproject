          <h4>Twelve pillars by Jim Pohn</h4>
          <p style="font-family: Papyrus,fantasy;">this is a book that mainly focuses on teaching positive principles to its readers and attemps to allow them to be the best of themselves
           <br> Some lessons i learned from my readings are:</p>

                    <li>
                    <h4>The only way things are going to change for you is when you change</h4>
          <p style="font-family: Papyrus,fantasy;"> A lot of people think working hard is the key to success, and it is, but it is only one piece of the success puzzle.  For you to get a better job, with more money, and more opportunity, you must increase your skill set.  Which requires you to change your thoughts, your actions, and what you do everyday.

<br>The conversations between the two of them are deep and every sentence has a pearl of wisdom. </p>
                    </li>
                      <li>
                        <h4> Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity </h4>
                        <p style="font-family: Papyrus,fantasy;">We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.  The difference is that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons.  Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on.
                          Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend you time on urgent, spend your time on what is important. We must be our own designer of our lives.</p>
                        </li>
                      <li>
                        <h4>What you become directly influences what you get</h4>
                        <p style="font-family: Papyrus,fantasy;">The skills you develop to become a millionaire is more important the than money itself.  Money can always go away.  You can lose it.  You can get sued, inflation can eat it away.  It can be stolen.  Every year you hear of what were once millionaires and multimillionaires having to file for bankruptcy, going from hundreds of millions of dollars to nothing.  However, many of them can come back from these things because of the skills they learned to accumulate such wealth.  The skills can never be taken away.

Income seldom exceeds personal development.  To increase your paycheck, you must increase your skills.</p>
